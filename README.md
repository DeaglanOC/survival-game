# Survival Game Prototype

## Features:

• Random generation of trees and rocks on terrain.

Spawn points are selected on the terrain by generating random X and Z co-ordinates, then the terrain is sampled for it's height value which is set to the Y value, and a tree or rock is generated in that position.
